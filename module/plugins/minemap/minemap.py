# This is the dict the webui will try to "load".
#  *here we register one page with both addresses /dummy/:arg1 and /dummy/, both addresses
#   will call the function get_page.
#  * we say that for this page, we are using the template file dummy (so view/dummy.tpl)
#  * we said this page got some static stuffs. So the webui will match /static/dummy/ to
#    the dummy/htdocs/ directory. Beware: it will take the plugin name to match.
#  * optional: you can add 'method': 'POST' so this address will be only available for
#    POST calls. By default it's GET. Look at the lookup module for sample about this.
